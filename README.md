# Knowledge Bases SDK (RFC)

The goal of the Knowledgebase SDK is to make it dead simple to build and use MindsDB's large-scale semantic search capabilities. With a straightforward SDK to: load data, search, and obtain answers from vast amounts of unstructured information in just a few lines of code.


> **NOTE:** We'll dive into `expert-mode` soon—for those who prefer coding with their hoodie up, tinkering with every last detail- But first, let's enjoy the simplicity of the default `hassle-zero` mode.

## How to create a knowledge base from scratch

Creating knowledge bases (KB)s is as simple as a few lines of code.
For example, this is how to create a KB from PDFs containing SEC filings:

```python
from minds_sdk import Client
from pathlib import Path
import datetime
from pydantic import BaseModel

# The schema we want our knowledge base to have.
# Note that some attributes are structured while others are not. 
# During search, we will use both types (i.e., hybrid search).
class FilingSchema(BaseModel):
    report_type: str
    company: str
    filing_date: datetime.date
    most_relavant_data_json: dict  
    summary: str

# Simply insert anything you want into the KB
kb = Client(<api_key>).kb.create('sec_filings', FilingSchema)
for pdf_file in Path("quarterly_filings_folder").glob("*.pdf"):
    kb.insert(pdf_file, report_type='quarterly')  
```



When inserting into a Knowledge Base, unless you say otherwise, MindsDB Server works on your behalf to handle all the heavy lifting most people gladly skip:
- Extracts info from files (PDFs, etc.) 
- Tames messy content to fit into the schema you provide, merging it with whatever metadata you specify
- Indexes your text attributes for lightning-fast semantic search

> Every `insert` request is managed asynchronously, making it very fast to send large amounts of data into a Knowledge Base.

## Semantic Search over a Knowledge Base
```python
from minds_sdk import Client

# Example for seamntic search over SEC Filings 
# Load a pre-existing knowledge base 'sec_filings'
kb = Client(base_url=.., api_key=..).kb('sec_filings')

# Semantic Search 
results = kb.search("Quarterly reports for NVIDIA during H2 2024")

# Analyze results
answer = results.analyze("What changed in revenue?")

# Unbound analysis over the entire KB 
answer = kb.analyze("Quarterly revenue for NVIDIA over the past 5 years")

# Semantic Search with literal metadata filters 
results = kb.search("NVIDIA during H2 2024", report_type="Quarterly")
```

The goal with this part of the SDK is simple: **ask a question and get the answer your need**—`fast`. As such; the default for `.search(<plain language query>)` method auto-magically determines hybrid metadata filtering and semantic search over unstructured data to return the most relevant results. Likewise; If instead of a list results, what you want is a direct answer from either your search results or the entire knowledge base, use `.analyze(<plain language question>)`. That's it! No agents bs, no fuss—just answers.



## `expert-mode` 

As promised, let's dive into `expert-mode`.

#### .insert(<content>, <optional: attrs>)


The `insert` method is designed for maximum flexibility and ease-of-use.

- The *first unnamed argument* is assumed to be the main content you want to insert into the knowledge base. This can be:
  - Raw text (`str`)
  - A file pointer (e.g., opened PDF, image, etc.)
  - A valid HTTP(S) URL (`HttpUrl` string)
  - Or a Pydantic object matching your schema.
> **Tip:** For best auto-extraction accuracy, document your schema attributes in the Pydantic class using descriptive field docs.


- **Named arguments** let you set any attribute directly (`key=<value>`) and skip auto-fill for that specific attribute (`<value>` can be `None`). 

    - If you don't specify an `id`, MindsDB will automatically generate one by taking an MD5 hash of the content. 
    - Globally disable autofill using `_auto_fill=False`.




Example: Explicit no auto-fill
```python
kb.insert(
    file_pointer, 
    file_name="filing.pdf", 
    company = 'NVIDIA',
    _auto_fill=False  # skip autofill for all other missing fields
)
```
